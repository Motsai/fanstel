# Fanstel BlueNor CAD Libraries

At Motsai, we like the Fanstel BlueNor modules as we feel that they provide very good value for the 
money and are based around a clever design.

The castellated footprint allow the use of low cost PCBs (2-layer recommended) to perform the breakout from the edge pads and perform 
hand soldering of the modules.  For more advanced designs all the Nordic SoC pins are available under the module using land grid array
with a pitch that is not too difficult to support in production.  Other modules have very tight pad pitch and this makes it more difficult
to avoid voids.

This repository holds our Altium parts for the Fanstel BlueNor modules.  We love Altium Designer and use it exclusively
for our customer's design.  We wish to share with the community the footprints and MCAD models that we use internally.

The library comes with no warranty, but we have used those footprint ourself in projects and they work for our needs.  Like any
library they should be validated for your design, but its good to start from something stable.
